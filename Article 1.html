                        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the famous Dartmouth workshop in 1956 to the Aladdin investment software created by BlackRock, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has conquered every segment of our life. And the world of finance has not escaped from its appetite. Financial Institutions are increasingly relying on AI for automation, better decision-making, and customization. Yet, this fast-evolving technology has taken power in the heavily regulated and mature finance industry without being seriously threatened by any regulatory attempt. And its reign might last longer than expected.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AI ascends the throne :</span><br></h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defining AI is such a perilous journey but dissecting AI-enabled strategies in finance shows that they are all built on weak AI which is limited to a particular task and large dataset. Its performance on those specific problems is far beyond human capability, yet it is not an upgraded imitation of the human brain therefore their application on financial services is very likely to be supervised by humans.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        </figure><p>          The potential of AI in financial services is limitless, indeed finance has abundant data and has the resources to build and maintain AI. A recent survey by NVIDIA showed that 83% of financial services professionals agreed to say that this technology is essential to their company’s success. Various key areas such as lending, asset management, payments, and insurance are fertile grounds for this technology. <ul><li><strong>Lending</strong>: Automation has been introduced in loan application processes, to reduce cost, increase speed, and last but not least, make better lending decisions by using credit scores. Alipay is leading the sector.</li> <li><strong>Asset Management</strong>: AI aims at improving investment decisions in two ways. Building active portfolios like Two Sigma fund and offering over-performing low-cost ETF based on AI techniques to select investment factors. Aberdeen Global Artificial Intelligence Equity is a perfect example.</li> <li><strong>Insurance</strong>: AI enhances fraud detection by recognizing patterns of potentially fraudulent activity to redirect human agents on those sensitive cases, but it also enables insurance companies to better calibrate their insurance pricing and compensation for each situation thanks to AI-based analysis like CapeAnalytics.</li> <li><strong>Payments</strong>: Machine learning can improve real-time detection of payment fraud but also create new value propositions such as the partnership between credit card behemoth MasterCard and tech giant Google in order to better assess the impact of online marketing on consumers’ payment habits. Overall, banks are expected to potentially save more than $447 Bn by 2023 from AI applications according to Insider Intelligence’s report.</li></ul></p>
                        <h2 style="font-style: italic;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The mystery of the almighty king</span></em><br></h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, fast-paced innovations of AI have continuously made it more and more complex to a point where even computer scientists have no clue about how their algorithm decides from a pool of data. You may have heard about deep learning, known to be one of the best performing tools used to get insights from data but also the most obscure. <br></p>
                        <figure class="figure d-block"><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/NN.png" style="width: 629px;">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are complex Neural Network models which try to learn from data (input) in order to give decisions or predictions (output) by letting “hidden neurons” create connections to each other. Because of those several hidden layers, this type of model can be described as a “black box”. Consequently, financial professionals increasingly working with AI are aware of its obvious benefits but the risks are often unduly obscure and they are unlikely to be held responsible for AI harms. Regular citizens too can legitimately be concerned about data privacy used to train AI models as well as discriminating bias from predictive models as shown by a study conducted by Women’s World Banking. According to the study, biased AI systems may contribute to $17bn gender credit gap in developing markets.<br></p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regulators have to set limits to the unclear injurious effects of AI on financial stability but the task is challenging because it can be difficult to predict when harmful outcomes will happen, until people and organizations have been negatively impacted. The so-called Collingridge Dilemma depicted by David Collingridge in his book The Social Control of Technology demonstrates that there is an information and power problem with the regulation of new technology such as AI: <i>“When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time-consuming”</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, even if the list of grievances against AI is clear, Its Majesty has become so important today that regulation might be seen as a precipitous halt to a geopolitical competitive edge. Zuckerberg's recent threat to shut down Meta's main apps after the announcement of the forthcoming EU’s AI legislation is an illustration of the new paradigm that AI has settled for the future of business and finance: “Regulation is the opposite of Innovation”. Today, the United States and China are at the forefront of AI innovations in finance and strong global regulation is not likely to occur soon… The king might remain sacrosanct for a long time.<br><br></p>
